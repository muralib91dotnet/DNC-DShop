Microservices startup:
Either use,
DNC-DShop.Api/DNC-DShop.Api.Next to start with

Plus 7 Apis,
starting as DNC-DShop.Services.{API-Name}

RabbitMq/RawRabbit Service bus - Notes:
By default, RawRabbit uses the Default routing key as the name of the message(command/query)assembly. Therefore, to pass Class type(Command/Query class) itself as a SB message, we use,
'MessageNamespace' attribute along with string name as parameter. This string name is mentioned as "namespace":"namespace-name" in appsettings, under rabbitMq section.
Eg: [MessageNamespace("customers")] in CreateCustomer.cs
This namespace,identifies given type as command between different microservices, while each microservice(sender/receiver microservice) defines this Class again within each of its assemblies instead of keeping the Command/Query class as common assembly,
which maintains the SoC & decoupling of microservices
